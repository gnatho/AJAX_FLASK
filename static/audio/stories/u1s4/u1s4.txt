Carlos's Family Celebration
It's Mexican Independence Day!
Carlos and Selena are getting ready for a big party.
"We can decorate the house," says Carlos.
"Let's paint a picture of our family."
Mama was born first.
*01
"She is the oldest",
says Carlos.
"Papa was born second",
Carlos says.
"He is one year younger."
"Next is Mateo,"
says Carlos.
"He is Mama and Papa's first child."
"After Mateo, you were born,"
says Selena.
"That's right!"
says Carlos.
"I am Mama and Papa's second child."
"What about me?"
asks Selena.
"You were the last to be born,"
says Carlos.
"You are the youngest."
"There!"
says Carlos.
"Our family picture is done!" 
"Green, white, and red are the colors of the Mexican flag,"
says Carlos. 
"Carlos and Selena blow up five green balloons.
They blow up five white balloons
and five red balloons, too.
"I'm out of breath!" says Selena.
"Let's see," says Carlos.
"We painted a picture first.
We blew up balloons second.
The third thing we can do is fill the piñata."
Carlos gets the big star piñata from the shelf.
Carlos and Selena stuff the piñata with candy.
When Selena thinks Carlos isn't looking,
she pops a piece of candy into her mouth.
Carlos gives her a hug.
"You are silly," he says.
"Mateo hangs the piñata in the apartment's grassy yard.
"We need a blindfold," says Carlos.
"And a stick to break the piñata, too."
Abuela finds a red-checked scarf for Carlos
and a long stick for Selena. 
"The piñata is ready!"
says Carlos.
"The fourth thing to do is practice dancing, Selena!".
Carlos and Selena dress in their party clothes.
Then, they dance and spin.
Soon, the house fills up with food, family, and music.
There are cousins, aunts, uncles, new babies, and new friends.
There is Papa, Mama, Mateo, Carlos and Selena, too.
"There is one last thing we can do,"
Carlos says.
"And it's the most fun!"
"What is it?"
asks Selena.
"CELEBRATE!"
says Carlos.
