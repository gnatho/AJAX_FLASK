On My Street
I went to open my window.
The city air was cold.
A man in a brown hat was selling peanuts.
"Hot peanuts!".
He called loudly.
"Hello, Mr. Rose".
I called from my window.
"Hello, Gilbert". He called back.
I saw a man sweeping leaves.
He was singing.
He keeps our street nice and clean.
I went to help the man in the street.
He didn't see me.
I pulled on his coat.
He turned around.
He smiled.
"Hello, Dad!". I said.
I love the street where I live.
